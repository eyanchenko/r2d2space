# R2D2 goes to space
R code for implementing the R2D2 prior for spatial models from "Spatial regression modeling via the R2D2 framework" by Eric Yanchenko, Howard D. Bondell and Brian J. Reich. If you use these codes or find the paper useful for your research, please cite our paper. Note that we include the code for the real-data analysis but are unable to provide the dataset.
